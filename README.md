# UnrealGod
An old project by another author who seems to have abandoned this, so I'll take over from here.

To ensure that this mod runs smoothly, please be sure that you place the files is in your installation of Unreal Tournament 
(No matter which version you have on your device).

Once installed, go to your UnrealTournament.ini file in X:\Unreal Tournament>System and place the following lines under [Engine.GameEngine]:

ServerPackages=UGMaps

ServerPackages=UnrealGod

ServerPackages=AutoGod

Once done go in game and click on the Mod tab and check out the tab that pops up.

Use at your own risk with other maps and mutators. Still running tons of tests on various maps, mods and mutators.
