# UnrealGod
An old project by another author who seems to have abandoned this, so I'll take over from here.
Please note that you must have Unreal Tournament installed in order for this to work. Doesn't matter which version you have.

To ensure that this mod runs smoothly, please be sure that you place the files is in your installation of Unreal Tournament 
(No matter which version you have on your device).

Once installed, go to your UnrealTournament.ini file in X:\Unreal Tournament>System and place the following lines under [Engine.GameEngine]:

ServerPackages=UGMaps

ServerPackages=UnrealGod

ServerPackages=AutoGod

Once done go in game and click on the Mod tab and check out the tab that pops up.

Use at your own risk with other maps and mutators. Still running tons of tests on various maps, mods and mutators.

Works with the latest update for Monster Hunt and Monster Defense and Monster Arena. Don't forget to check out Monster Hunt by Shrimp. Will be adding a few new features and maps in the future.
